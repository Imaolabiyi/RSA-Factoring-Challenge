RSA Factoring Challenge
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

	n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

	This task is the same as task 0, except:

	p and q are always prime numbers
	There is only one number in the files
